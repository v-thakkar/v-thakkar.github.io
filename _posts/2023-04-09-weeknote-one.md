I have always found the idea of writing public weeknotes fascinating. Mainly because I love writing and reflecting. I do that a lot anyway, just not in public on this website. But I miss having a platform to share random things in public without an obligation to engage in sync conversations aboutit. For few years, it used to be twitter for me. And while I've been using mastodon on/off, I've mostly switched to interest based discord/slack/ groups since last one/two years. So consider this as my attempt to share random thoughts/observations/feelings more publicly. This probably will be one of many weeknotes I'll write this year or may be the first and last one. We will seehow this experiement goes, I don't have any specific agenda for it.

- Speaking of reflections, I mentioned an incident to my therapist about a boundary I was able to set this week and how uncomfortable it was to be able to stick with it after somebody tried to push it. The session turned into her reflecting on how far I've come from the day we started to work together. Apparently it was exactly a year ago so cheers to that. The conversation with her also made me think about how often we as a society end up disrespecting other people's boundaries in an attempt to help. Especially with respect to depression, there is a general theme of pushing people to talk/socialize. But more often than not what people don't realize is that, it works differently for different people especially those who have been handling their chronic illnesses for years. And while I'm grateful for living in a bubble where conversations around mental health is no longer a taboo topic, most people are still figuring out the ways to help others. Anyway, IME 'live and learn' is the good rule to abide by!

- It was quite sunny in Berlin this week so I'm looking forward to going for more afterwork walks in the evening.

- In other news, my apartment got flooded - like flooded flooded (plumber's words) this week because of upstairs neighbours. I love living in Altbaus here in Berlin as they seem to have some character than the neubaus which often just feels like walls without stories. But I've been starting to learn some hard lessons for this impratical romanticization. Although on this eventful Friday, I also got to experience the absolute kindness from my next door neighbours. And after the initial 15 mins of stress cry, my brain decided to focus on handling the situation so very grateful for that. I also got very lucky with respect to getting a plumber who spoke English so I got to learn a lot from him about the whole sewage system of Berlin/germany. Fun fact it was not until 1852 that Berlin became the last European capital to start building a water pipeline. Hah :D

- After the university, I never thought I will find the internals of JVM interesting but I guess life has it's own ways to surprise you. TLDR: sometimes learning about compilers, toolchains and everything in between can make you forget about your lunch. So this week I became the person who has 'lunch' as a calender reminder now.

- I still can't focus on new shows or read new books because my brain can't deal with unpredictable outcomes these days. I don't force it as hobbies are supposed to be pursued for the joy of it. So anyway because of this I started re-watching Modern Family and I've been enjoying it a lot. Although the moment my brain seems to be ready for it, I'm gonna dedicate a weekend just for the new season of Mandalorian.

- I've decided to give another chance to every-foods for the weekday lunches. Let's see if I like it this time.

- We discovered a new Indian restaurant in Charlottenburg and it was not bad. Sambhar tasted a bit more like Rasam but at least it was more closer to the south indian style than the north indian one.

- I discovered [NicNac's](https://lorenz-snacks.de/nicnacs) - courtesy of the person I've been seeing. And this is the first time I didn't regret having peanuts for the breakfast.
