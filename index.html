<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I'm Vaishali. I'm an open source hacker based out of Berlin, Germany.</p>

<p>I have been mostly working on Linux Kernel, embedded linux and system programming related stuff since last 5 years. Occassionally I also get involved with paid/volunteer projects related to open source community management, technical writing, documentation etc. You can check out my <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git/log/?qt=grep&q=vaishali+thakkar">Linux Kernel patches</a> and <a href="https://github.com/v-thakkar">github</a> profile to get some idea about my work.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer of open education and care about building kind and diverse communities. Usually I also like to get involved with local open source communities and meetups. Currently I'm associated with <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> as a (volunteer)coordinator for the linux kernel projects. I was associated as a co-organizer of <a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/">RGSoC</a> with Travis Foundation for 3 years.
I sometimes write on my <a href="/blog">blog</a> and make tech related <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1075669538639757312"> drawings</a>. I was used to write on <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Vaishali-Thakkar-1">quora</a> during the early days of my career but I'm not much active there these days!</p>

<p>I occasionally love speaking at conferences about open source, embedded systems, Linux kernel etc. I was used to conduct Linux Kernel workshops in Indian universities, I no longer do that. But the Linux kernel workshop material and slides of my all talks can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/v-thakkar/Talks">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/v-thakkar/Linux-Kernel-Workshop">here.</a></p>
